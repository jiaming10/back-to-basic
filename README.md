## Back to basic
This is a project inspired by http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/, https://justinjackson.ca/words.html, and https://bestmotherfucking.website/.

I always wanted to redesign my personal site's landing page, however I keep over-engineered it, wasting too much time on layout, and at the end it never saw the light. And so I decided to make it raw, and improve it little by little over time.

I'm aiming for improving the site for 30 consecutive days. The improvement might be minor, and might not even be reflected on UI, but that is OK, because this is ultimately my self-discipline test.

This website originally hosted on a shared hosting website, and now is hosted on GitHub Pages.
